# Relationships between Altcoins & Bitcoin

This project explores the relationship between the price percentage movement of the altcoins (Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, Cardano, and Binance Coin) and its effect and its use in prediction Bitcoin’s percentage price movement. Recent literature suggests that Bitcoin’s performance can manipulate market movement in the investment world of crypto assets. This paper reverse engineers the idea of smaller assets manipulating the price of Bitcoin through complex algorithms and traditional statistical modeling techniques. The goal is to find a relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins to increase prediction power of the models discussed.
